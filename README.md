# icons-in-terminal.el

This package is inspired by [all-the-icons](https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el).
is a utility for using and formatting various icon fonts within Emacs.  Icon
Fonts allow you to propertize and format icons the same way you would normal
text.  This enables things such as better scaling of and anti aliasing of the
icons.
